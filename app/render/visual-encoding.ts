/**
 * Pure visual-encoding rules — SPEC/06_UI_and_Interaction.md §3 and
 * SPEC/12_Map_Symbology_and_Projection.md §8. Deliberately library-free:
 * these are the *decisions* (which bucket, which stroke style, which
 * hue), not the drawing code, so they are testable without MapLibre, a
 * DOM, or a canvas.
 *
 * "The governing rule is that no property is carried by hue alone: every
 * one has a redundant non-colour channel." (SPEC/06 §3.2) Every function
 * here returns both the primary channel and names its required redundant
 * channel in its doc comment, so a caller cannot wire up the primary
 * encoding and forget the other.
 *
 * NOT implemented here, deliberately: symbol *shapes* for the four
 * standard identities (own formation / aerial asset / fire / value at
 * risk). SPEC/11_Open_Design_Register.md §3.10 lists these as "Not
 * drawn... blocks test/render/cvd.spec" — a named open item, not settled
 * content. Guessing at shapes here would be exactly the kind of thing
 * SPEC/11 says to stop and ask about rather than invent. The *hue*
 * assignments (§8.1 below) are fully specified and safe to encode; the
 * shapes are not.
