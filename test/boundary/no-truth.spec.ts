/**
 * M3 acceptance test (SPEC/10_Build_Plan_and_Acceptance.md, M3):
 * "`test/boundary/no-truth.spec` walks the live render tree at every
 * logged `seq` of a golden run and asserts no reachable object contains
 * any `TruthAnnotation` key."
 *
 * Scope note for this milestone (see also `render-tree.ts`'s header):
 * this checks the render *tree* — the data a map component would draw
 * from — not an actual rendered DOM/canvas via MapLibre. Building that
 * needs real geographic tile data (PMTiles) through `tools/bundle/` (not
 * built — it is the only module permitted outbound network access, a
 * separate and substantial task involving real licensed data fetches)
 * and a browser/WebGL test harness this session has not set up. The tree
 * this test walks is exactly what SPEC/10 M3 describes checking, and is
 * the part of "the render boundary" I4 is actually about — a real
 * MapLibre layer reading from a truth-free tree cannot itself leak truth
 * either, so this is the load-bearing half of the guard.
