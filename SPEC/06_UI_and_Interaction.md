## 1. The principle

The map is the work surface. Everything else is either pushed onto it or lives behind a button.

This reduces the information architecture to one decision — what is on the surface and what is one click away — and it **improves the measurement**. A drawer behind a button makes opening it an act, and therefore a measure: time from cycle start to first open, how long it stays open, which tab within it, how often per cycle, and whether it is ever opened at all. A participant who never opens the search drawer during a cycle has told you something precise that a permanently-visible panel would have hidden.

### 2.1 Persistent

**The map**, occupying most of the viewport. Unit and asset markers, observation bubbles, the fire perimeter as last reported, the projection envelope with its validity horizon, and the participant's own marked geometry.

**A status strip**, thin, along the top edge: incident clock, cycle number, own formations with status and the **age** of each status, and the count of unread reports.

**An incoming report rail** along one side: new bubbles announce themselves here as they arrive and can be opened from here or from the map. Items scroll away. **Nothing is pushed again after its arrival.** The rail is scrollable back **within the current cycle only**; older items live in the search drawer, which is what makes searching necessary rather than optional.

### 2.2 Behind buttons

**`Haku` — the search drawer.** One button, present in **every** condition, opening a panel that widens over the map. Inside it: situation log, traffic log, unit status with ages, and reference data (stand, road, water, maintenance).

Contents differ by condition exactly as the capability matrix specifies (`02` §2). In `directed` the drawer offers browsing and filtering by unit or time window, and the traffic log by named unit only. In `assistive` and `substitutive` the same drawer additionally carries a free-text field searching across all of it.

**`Avaa tekoäly` — the AI drawer.** Present in `assistive` and `substitutive`; **absent in `directed`**, not disabled. In `assistive` it returns corpus facts verbatim with source and time. In `substitutive` it does that and also answers within the channel's vocabulary.

**`Radio` — the radio panel.** Present in all three conditions. Addresses a named formation or the duty officer. Typed, not spoken: the study needs *what participants asked* to be comparable across conditions, and speech would exist only as audio requiring transcription that is expensive, lossy and arrives too late to inform piloting. The realism cost is accepted deliberately and declared.

### 2.3 Pushed, therefore not behind a button

In `substitutive` the channel's signal set appears **in the report rail** alongside incoming reports, visually distinguished, at its fixed cadence including the all-clear. It cannot sit behind a button, because being pushed is the manipulation.

### 2.4 The probe surface

Takes over the viewport when a probe begins. In `PROBING_VISIBLE` the map and envelope remain rendered beneath or beside it. In `PROBING_BLANKED` the map, rail, drawers and status strip are all removed.

### 2.5 Drawer behaviour — settled

A drawer **persists across the cycle boundary**, so a participant who left it open is not silently reset. Its state is logged at every boundary.

A drawer is dismissible by clicking the map or pressing Escape. Both dismissal routes are logged distinctly.

Only one drawer is open at a time; opening a second closes the first, and both events are logged.

At the minimum viewport (1280 × 800) the drawer occupies at most 55% of the width, so the map remains usable beneath it. Below that the pre-flight check refuses the session.

## 3. Information-design rules

Derived from one principle: **read models expose freshness, provenance, uncertainty, limitations and validity horizons, and never silently substitute data.**

**Every displayed element carries a visible source and an observation time.** Nothing appears without provenance.

**Staleness is visible and graded, not binary.** A unit position whose last report is twelve minutes old is rendered as stale, never as present-at-last-known-position.

**`unknown` has a visual form of its own**, distinct from `zero`, `absent` and `stale`. This is the single most important rule and the easiest to lose: a blank cell reads as "nothing there" when it should read as "not known".

**Certainty is rendered from the same four-value vocabulary the channel uses** — `confirmed`, `probable`, `uncertain`, `unknown` — with one consistent visual encoding everywhere it appears.

**The basemap is deliberately low-salience** so it does not compete with the situational layer or the channel. Extraneous visual load is not a manipulated variable and must not be introduced accidentally.

**Layer state is explicit and logged.** A participant with a layer switched off has a different picture and the analysis must know.

### 3.1 Typography

```
Plex Sans   interface chrome, labels, probe text, report body
Plex Mono   unit designators, timestamps, coordinates, grid references,
            wind values — anything to be read back or compared character by character
Plex Serif  long-form ground reports, marking them typographically as
            human-authored prose distinct from system output
```

**The serif/sans distinction is not decoration.** A participant must be able to tell at a glance whether they are reading a human report or a system-generated signal, because confusing the two would confound the channel manipulation. Typeface is one of the cheapest ways to carry that distinction. It is applied consistently and documented in the validity claim.

Self-hosted, SIL OFL 1.1, subset to Latin plus Finnish diacritics (`05` §8).

### 3.2 The visual encoding system

Certainty (four values), staleness (graded), tier provenance, urgency (four levels) and the `unknown` state each need a distinct visual treatment that survives together on one map without collapsing into noise, remains legible for colour-vision deficiency, and works on a poor laptop panel.

**Specified in `12` §8.** The governing rule is that no property is carried by hue alone: every one has a redundant non-colour channel. `12` also settles how the projection envelope is drawn (one boundary, no gradation — `12` §3), what is drawn on units and aircraft (`12` §6), and the reported-rate mark that carries magnitude (`12` §5).

## 4. The time and interaction model

### 4.1 Stepped world, continuous information

**The world state advances in discrete steps at cycle boundaries.** The fire perimeter, unit positions and asset positions are redrawn once per cycle and then hold still. The map presents a *last reported situation at a stated time* — "tilanne klo 14:35" — not a live view. **Nothing animates.**

**Information arrives continuously within the cycle.** Observation bubbles appear at authored offsets across the working period, so reports accrue while the participant is reading, in an order that matters and at a rate they cannot fully absorb. This is where tempo, workload and attention allocation live.

**The clock is visible and running during the working period, and halted during every probe.** Participants must be able to reason about elapsed time and rates, so the scenario clock and each element's age are always on screen.

### 4.2 Why the fire must not animate

If the perimeter moves smoothly, participants extrapolate visually from motion. That is a perceptual task and a *different* task from the one under study. It would also swamp the manipulation: a participant who can watch the fire advance does not need the channel's integration, so the difference between `assistive` and `substitutive` would shrink toward nothing and the primary contrast would null out for reasons having nothing to do with the hypothesis.

It is also less realistic, not more. No incident commander watches a live animated perimeter. They receive periodic timestamped reports and reason forward from them, which is exactly what the stepped model reproduces.

### 4.3 Change highlighting

At the start of each cycle the map redraws and the changed elements are briefly and explicitly marked — new perimeter, moved units, new reports — with the marking decaying after a few seconds.

Same reason in miniature. Without highlighting, the participant must detect change by comparing the new picture against a remembered one, which is a visual change-detection task adding variance unrelated to the construct. **The change detection this study measures is between reports and the projection, not between two map frames.** Remove the perceptual version so the cognitive one is measurable.

### 4.4 Validity horizons are rendered, always

Every projection carries its horizon on screen — *ennuste voimassa klo 15:05 saakka* — and every situational element carries its observation time and age. A projection without a stated horizon cannot be judged for containment; an element without an age cannot be judged for staleness. Both are measures.

### 4.5 What the participant can and cannot do

> **[SUPERSEDED 2026-09-17]** Participants can also choose a course of action each cycle; see amendment.

**Can:** open bubbles and read reports; send radio requests; query (where available); request lateral traffic; pan within the extent and change between fixed zoom levels; toggle layers; mark an expectation; judge the projection, mark a failure location, draw a corrected projection; assign formations and assets to sectors and tasks; write a short rationale.

**Cannot:** move units directly on the map; alter the fire; change the weather; affect what happens next.

### 4.6 Allocations are recorded and scored, and they do not change the scenario

The fire develops as authored regardless of what is assigned where. This is deliberate and it is the price of the study's central property: **every participant must face an identical event stream**, or projection accuracy is not comparable between them and the primary measures collapse.

State it plainly in the briefing — that the incident develops according to its own dynamics, fixed in advance so that all participants face the same situation, and that decisions are recorded and evaluated. Officers understand a scripted exercise; what damages engagement is discovering the scripting late and feeling misled, not being told at the start.

**Do not tell participants their decisions "do not matter."** They are scored for robustness and safety against the branch set, and the relationship between a stated doubt and the subsequent allocation is a primary measure.

### 4.7 The contingent-delivery variant, and why it is rejected

An attractive middle path exists: allocations could determine *which* reports arrive as pushed bubbles, so that assigning a unit to a sector produces observations from that sector while the fire stays scripted. Agency is preserved, the fire stays comparable, and a new measure appears — whether participants allocate to fight fire or to gather information.

**Rejected for this study** because it breaks the identical-event-stream property the primary measures depend on: different participants would see different pushed information, and between-participant divergence in judgements could no longer be attributed to reasoning rather than to inputs.

Recorded as a candidate for a later study, where agency rather than comparability is the question.

## 5. Language

**Everything the participant sees is Finnish.** No literal strings in components; all text resolves through `i18n/` from a single string table, which is also what makes the Finnish register reviewable as a unit by the domain reviewer.

Probe wording rules: no leading terms; the uncertainty probe must not mention conflict, inconsistency, or reports disagreeing, or it becomes a prompt rather than a measure. Numeric items state their unit. Categorical options are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, with an explicit *ei tiedossa* where "don't know" is a meaningful answer.

**The string table is a deliverable and is not yet written.** See `11` §2.4.

---

## 6. Accessibility and refusal

The instrument is not a public product and does not need to meet a general accessibility standard, but two things are required for validity rather than compliance.

Colour is never the sole carrier of certainty, staleness or urgency — shape, position or label carries it too. Otherwise a participant with colour-vision deficiency is in a different condition from everyone else.

Text is resizable to 125% without layout collapse, since participants run this on their own machines at their own settings.

Where an environment cannot support the instrument, the pre-flight check **refuses and records the refusal**. It never degrades silently: a degraded session produces data that looks valid and is not.

## Amendment 2026-09-17

**Course-of-action panel.** Four option cards in seeded order, a confidence slider, and a confirm button, shown before the allocation surface. For reasoning-AI participants in the guidance-via-AI cell, in phase B, the alignment statement appears in the AI drawer style after the initial choice, followed by a final-choice prompt that pre-selects the initial option.

**SPAM overlay.** A small non-modal card at the top of the map: ready prompt with *Valmis*, then the question and a confidence slider. The map and tools remain usable. Must not cover the projection envelope or the report rail.

**Freezes.** Five SA items per freeze, each followed by a confidence slider (0–100), same component as Type J. L3 items use the blank-map point or polygon input.

**Prologue and tutorial.** The prologue uses the `directed` layout for everyone. The tutorial then introduces the AI drawer (AI groups) or a matched-length neutral map exercise (no-AI group).

---

## Revision 17 Sep 2026 (d) — supersedes earlier amendments where they conflict

- **No alignment feedback panel** (removed).
- **Tutorial:** AI participants learn the query drawer (what it answers, phrasing, two practice queries); no-AI participants get a matched-length radio and browsing tutorial.
- **Branch list:** after the correction polygon is committed, a list of four statements plus *Ei mikään näistä* (always last), single choice, no text field.
- **Confidence sliders** render without a thumb until first touched.
- **Cell 3:** intent lines appear as a distinct final line inside AI answers, same typography as the answer, no highlight colour.
